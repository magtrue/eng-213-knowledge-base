# New Media Terminology

Many of the terms we use in refernece to computer functions have become second nature to us by now, "I just need to reboot it", "there are some bugs to iron out", "just copy and paste it on this datasheet". Many of these have their roots in the development of early computer systems, such as the bug refering to an actual event in which a moth inside of an early computer casued miscalculations. Although as Manovich claims, some of these terms have deeper roots in older avant-garde society, with examples such as,
>"For example, the avant-garde strategy of collage reemerged as a "cut and paste" command", Manovich. p21

>"In another example, the dynamic windows, pull-down menus, and HTML
tables all allow a computer user to simultaneously work with practically unrestricted
amount of information despite the limited surface of the computer screen. This strategy
can be traced to Lissitzky's use of movable frames in his 1926 exhibition design for the
International Art Exhibition in Dresden", Manovich. p21


Manovich makes these comparisions in order to show examples of how new media represents a modern version of the avant-garde, describing it as a period of great influence where people attempt to create in new ways, but different in that they dont attempt to restructure what they see, rather they attempt to access what is already there in new ways. I find this take interesting, at least the front end side of the statement, with the origins of the terms. Even if I do not completely agree with Manovich on his point on the new world no longer concerning themselves with representing the world in new ways, I at least find his cut and paste argument fairly interesting, although his second example more of a strecth. 

## Avant-Garde or not

While manovich finds many correlations, the cut and paste term could also just as well reference the publishing technique, which was around long before the 1920s. While manovich makes no claims on his second example of direction correclation, the idea seems fairly far fetched, or he he calls it, traced. The more plausible idea in my mind is that the concept of windows was reached independintly by both parties, as both would have different intetions. On Manovichs third point of 
>"The new avant-garde is no longer concerned with seeing or representing the world in new
ways but rather with accessing and using in new ways previously accumulated media. In
this respect new media is post-media or ”meta-media“, as it uses old media as its primary
material", Manovich. p20

His claim of the "new avant garde not concerning itself with seeing the world in new ways," I would say has not held up well into the modern day. His second claim, that we use previously accumulated media in new ways holds up, but we see the world in data now more than ever. We represent everything as current and even future as data, not just past accumulations. It might be that Manovichs new avant-garde era has already come to a close, and we have entered a new era at this point which does concern it self in seeing the world in new ways, an era that is a mix of this and something new, but that is up for further research.
