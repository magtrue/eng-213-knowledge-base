## **Today’s Reading**

From our class discussions recently, we explored how rhetorical velocity and algorithms
can affect how content is processed and viewed on online platforms. Today’s reading discussed 
how science communication can be simplified so that more people can understand its content 
and that the videos themselves will be more interesting to all ages. The main goal of this study 
was to determine the audience’s response to various Kurzgesagt science videos (“‘We Lied to 
You… and We’ll Do It Again’—Communicating Science via YouTube”).

## **Results from the Kurzgesagt Study**

1.	Content-Focused
One observation from this section was that the research study’s goal was not to 
“oversimplify” science communication but was rather hoping to make the content 
understandable.

2.	Appreciation
How appreciation was measured was based on the comments that the videos received 
from the viewers. The ones that were listed in the reading were positive comments.

3.	Affect
This part of the study seemed the most prominent since more than half of the viewers 
were influenced to do something related to science by watching the videos.

## **Applications from Previous Readings**

Glotfelter mentioned in her essay “Algorithmic Circulation: How Content Creators 
Navigate the Effects of Algorithms on Their Work” that “the idea of algorithmic circulation 
adopts a perspective that sees the success of content as dependent upon
humans, algorithms, and other nonhuman agents” (Glotfelter 3). To connect today’s reading to 
her article about algorithms, her essay shows that humans use algorithms to get their content
across to a wide audience of people, or they can filter whom the content goes to.

From DeVoss and Ridolfo’s essay “Composing for Recomposition:
Rhetorical Velocity and Delivery,” they discussed how the content’s rhetorical mode is important 
to determine what is the best way to reach an audience” (DeVoss and Ridolfo 6). The content’s 
format is probably one of the most important aspects that would make someone want to look 
at it or not based on the presentation of it.

The first part of this knowledge base post explains the redefinition of rhetorical velocity 
and how it can be used outside of an educational setting. This relates to today’s reading
since the science videos that were viewed were in multiple settings and not just in an 
educational setting.

2.	[2025-09-16-hymes.md] (https://github.com/rickwysocki/eng-213-knowledge-base/blob/main/2025-09-16-hymes.md)
This knowledge base post focuses on rhetorical velocity and delivery and how 
immediacy is a major factor in how fast content is viewed. Even though today’s reading 
does not discuss too much on the delivery aspect of content, I thought that it was 
interesting how much science videos can be influential to a broad audience.

3.	[2025-09-16-hopkins.md] (https://github.com/rickwysocki/eng-213-knowledge-base/blob/main/2025-09-16-hopkins.md)
The first part of this knowledge base post connects rhetorical velocity to the audience. 
How fast content is shared online will determine how fast the audience will receive it.
