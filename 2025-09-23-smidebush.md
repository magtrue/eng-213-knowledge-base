# Science Communication Through Social Media
### Overview
When discussing and communicating various science concepts through a social media platform, there are different things social media content creators must keep in mind. For example, they must keep in mind the "long-tail" focus of their content. This refers to the long-term influence of the content on the audience and how it affects or changes their lives after watching or consuming the media.
Science commununication is also multimodal when communicating via social media platforms like YouTube. Additionally, these platforms have the affordances of access and visability, making it easier to reach wider audiences. Because of this, another thing content creators must keep in mind is how they are going to convey their message, something that can be an especially difficult task for those specializing in science communication. To do this, they must first oversimplify certain topics before building them up to discuss them as the complicated topics they are. Distilling down these complex science concepts can be difficult to do, especially when trying it fit it within a short five to ten minute long YouTube video. While some might view this as lying, others see it as a necessary step when tackling the topic of science communication. 

### Types of Audience Reactions on Social Media
According to Young et al. in their article titled "'We Lied to You...and We'll Do It Again'â€” Communicating Science via YouTube," there are three different types of comments that can be found on science communication YouTube videos, like videos from the channel Kurzgesagt.
##### Type 1: Content-focused
These kinds of comments on social media reveal what topics in a video the audience focused on or found interesting. This can be useful for science-based content creators because it give them insight on what the audience found to be important or useful information, letting them know what to focus their videos on in the future. 
##### Types 2: Appreciation
These kinds of comments on social media reveal positive or neutral comments or praise on a video. These usually focus more on responding to the content creators themselves rather than the content of the video and take a more broad approach to their message. 
##### Types 3: Affect
These kinds of comments on social media reveal the effect a video had on the audience. In these comments, the audience shares personal experiences of how this video or the content creators in general changed their life in some way. These comments are useful for content creators when looking at the long-tail effects of their content, letting them know how they are affecting their audience.
