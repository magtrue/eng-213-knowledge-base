## **Ideas about Digital Rhetoric and New Media Studies**
#### Concept #1:
##### Some key terms and ideas about digital rhetoric and new media studies that
stand out to me would have to be Representation and Audience because the
representation are important on how view digital rhetoric and media and how it
represents and relates to reality. I would define this as an important factor on
how the society has changed overall within the lifespan we have seen throughout
decades. Now for audience, it talks about who watches the media and why. Its
arguably one of the most important factors because its being created to appeal to
someone (aka us, humans).

## **Digital Experiences**
#### Concept #2:
##### The ideas from our readings relate to my own digital experiences would have
to be when I had some occurrences where I had been scammed on social media for
someone trying to take my account over and I've learned from that and been more
aware of who to trust. Another occurrence when this happened is when I am getting
mean things said about me by one of my friends' friends and I don't know what all
there is I can do about it, and I have just ignored it because what else is there
that I can do. It will go away if you don't think about it.

## **Digital Literacies**
#### Concept #3:
##### To me for what digital literacies I've gained/been exposed to would have to
be, gaining skills from the things I learn such as I am learning new things about
in this class about digital literacies, digital rhetoric, new media studies, etc.

## **Personal Thoughts**
#### Concept #4:
##### Personally, I don't have any questions to ask about digital rhetoric,
digital literacies and new media as I feel like I've explained my thinking's and my
occurrences very well above. Though as I think about It, I have one question in
particular.
###### This relates back into the 2nd bullet point.

# **Closing Thoughts**
### Why do people have the decency to scam someone when doing it has no purpose?
You're not gaining anything out of it.
