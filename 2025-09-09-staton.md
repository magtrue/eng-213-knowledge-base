# Title: Writing as the Ultimate Technology
# Layout: Page

We have undersood writing to be an integral part of our lives for forever. From the beginning, we have grown up to trace letters line by line on charts, perfect the curls of cursive, and turn our verbal words into visible modes on paper. Writing, in this sense, does not seem very technolgically advanced. Even though we acknowledged pencils and paper as tools, they were so common and mundane we did not consider them "technology". However, as Walter Ong points out in "[Writing is a Technology that Restructures Thought](https://bsu.instructure.com/courses/174253/assignments/2193241?module_item_id=5904058)", simple writing was a technological phenomenon in Plato's age, and not necessarily an accepted one: 

> Writing, Plato has Socrates say in the *Phaedrus*, is inhuman, pretending to establish outside the mind what in reality can only be in the mind. Writing is simply a thing, something to be manipulted, something inhuman, artificial, a manufactured product.

Thinking in this kind of space makes one realize that anything can be considered technology outside of the given human being; this is especially true as we consider the context of time that said technology was introduced. 
Considering writing as a technology itself, how radically, then, is it transformed when utilized digitally? As soon as modern computers were invented, writing was elevated to a digital status it will never look back from. While yes, one can still write with pen and paper, there will always be ascpects of writing never fully separable from the digital world. In the terms and concepts from the shared notes of "[Part One: Insights, Resources, and Applications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-J5WUhdD8Is3dzqSVJOq-TElWssGMa7gGKdx1Ii80AY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.wkoj2plfdlbx)", we can see words like "media incorporation" and "distribution" that ultimately relate to writing seen and incorporated as a technology. Liz Zirkle's points in her Insight from the second page of "[Insights, Resources, and Applications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-J5WUhdD8Is3dzqSVJOq-TElWssGMa7gGKdx1Ii80AY/edit?tab=t.93grv31dnof#heading=h.wkoj2plfdlbx)" reponse truly relate to this as well. Writing has indeed shifted from print to digital, and the conventions for that have changed.
