# Technology and Rhetoric Has Evolved, So So Should Our Terminology
Due to the rapid development of technology and media inaqudeuacies have developed in the terminology we use to describe rhetoric. Today, writers are composing strategically knowing that their writing will be recomposed. Therefore, they are writing with a new rhetorical audience in mind: the initial audience and the audience of the recomposition.

## The Redefining of Rhetorical Delivery

McLuhan said, "Our official culture is striving to force the new media to do the work of the old." Therefore, there has been a call to redefine what rhetorical delievery is. Early work in this field placed an emphasis on how it is delieverd in a classroom, embodiment, and its context within the political landscape. However, newer research suggests that the emphasis should be on distribution sustems, economics, and activism. Ultimately, the combination of these ideas suggests that rhetorical delivery is not just about technical delivery but also abut the delivery of politics, ethics, and media infastructures.

## What Exactly is Rhetorical Velocity?

Rhetorical velocity refers to the practice of composing with the anticipation of remixing and redistribution. It also considers how third-parties may re-use a text and weighing the pros and cons of that appropriation. In sum, it places an emphasis on both the strategic choices of the format, timing, and the medium as well as the speed at which texts circulate from network to network. Looking at rhetoric though this lense shows how delivery is not just a transimssion but also a knowledge-generation process which reveals patterns of cross-references and rhetorical impact.

## Should We Teach Children Rhetoric Differently?

Kathi Yancey calls to recognize that students are already writing and circulating texts often in digital spaces. She, along with others, argue that the study of composition needs to be adapted so that students can learn to think about delivery, circulation, and rheotircal velocity, or how texts evolve from platform to platform. An example given would be to give a classroom assignment where students must analyze press releases and their reuses to discover how these tets are evolving across platforms.
