# Lies and Oversimplifications; on Online Discourse
The reading for this week came from an article titled, ""We Lied to You... and We'll Do It Again"â€” Communicating Science via YouTube" which focussed its study on a Kurzesagt video and its reception with the same name. It brought concepts such as the long tail of science, or the unforseeable effects of studies long into the future. One of the correlations from comments studied from the video were ideas that the videos did not lie, but rather simplified larger ideas into more digestible ones. Here begins the divide, between lies and Oversimplifications. 

## Intention
An easy way to descrie the difference between the two is to define a lie as having the intent to carry misinformation, while an oversimplification has the intent to carry information. Even if niether are truths, its the intent that mattered right? Taking the studied video for example, the title itself is a lie. It was derived with the intent to gather attention and reactions from viewers, which contrasts the ideas within the video of oversimplification. Even though the title is an oversimplification of the concepts within, the intent of the title was muddied by other objectives. Intent is inheritely hard to gauge though, and as such there is a lot of overlap between a lie and misinformation from an outside perspective, and even sometimes from the creator of the statement.

>However, they then clarified and toned down their rhetoric of lying and moved to "oversimplification" when they added a bit later, that by "lies" they meant "the concept of 'lies to children'" (0:35), meaning that "on the path to explaining something complicated you start off with a little lie, a useful oversimplification, that makes it easier to grasp a concept"

# Outside of Science Discourse
While lies and oversimplications are hard to determine within most scientific discourse, if they attempt to explain a concept, there usually is a defenite right answer that can be reached by doing ones own research. Wether or not that "right" answer is true or not is less of the point, what matters is that they can circumvent the oversimplification or lie and attain the most recent understanding of a concept on their own. This of course is time consuming and unreasonable to do, but it is possible. Where things get worse is with online discourse outside of the scientific sphere where checks and balances are in place. In many cases, even when there is a defenite factual, "right" answer, such as a reporting of an event, intent may be to intertwined with it to ever come across the facts directly. Intent becomes even harder to gauge with the vast ammounts of information and viewpoints, all of which are shown with the same importance, bar algorithmic decisions and factors such as likes and reposts. 

# Connections
1. 2025-09-23-smidebush.md -> Provides a great summary of the text, and brings up conecpts up building up after an oversimplication. This would show be a great example of showing intent, as it shows an intent to spread the correct knowledge over time.
2. 2025-09-23-knebel.md -> introduces the concept that all scientific communication is oversimplification, which may be true in some aspect, but i believe it can also come from a place of the intention to spread misinformation. There is such a thing as "bad" science, science built on causing harm and affirming negative beliefs. IF any results posted from these studies were twisted in a way that benefited what the author wanted to say, I would classfify it as a lie rather than an oversimplification.
