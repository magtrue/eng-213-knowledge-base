# Ridolfo and DeVoss: Composing for Recomposition - Notes
#### Rhetorical Velocity and Delivery

I like to think of this as being how fast information and data can be transferred digitally, while also thinking about what is going into the writing of that transferred data. I like to tie this back to immediacy because it really seems more like the measure of speed that something has digitally. In an earlier reading by Manovich, immediacy is described to "eliminate distance" between two parties (Manovich). This is very closely related to speedy transfers of information and data between two parties. Rhetorical velocity, however, is more theoretical and more of a measurement in comparison. In other pages of the text as well, there are mentions of remixed media that can take place with rhetorical velocity and delivery. That reminds me of how, as a class, we have discussed how technology continues to be changed and adapted from previous technology. I think it was interesting to think about remixes that way. 

##### In Ridolfo and DeVoss: "Composing for Recomposition" :

" . . . a conscious rhetorical concern for distance, travel, speed, and time, pertaining specifically to theorizing instances of strategic appropriation by a third party."
" . . . a strategic approach to composing for rhetorical delivery. It is both a way of considering delivery as a rhetorical mode, aligned with an understanding of how texts work as a component of a strategy."

###### Categories to Consider:

1. Rapidity or speed of motion; swiftness.
2. Physics: A vector quantity whose magnitude is a body's speed and whose direction is the body's direction of motion.
3. The rate of speed of action or occurrence.

#### Connections to Other Class Discussions

##### Classmate 1: jacks-markdown-assignment.md
This post discusses audience when considering digital rhetoric. In this post, audience is described as " . . . who watches the media and why," with a highlight in the reason for creating a form of media. The post continues and states that "Its arguably one of the most important factors because its being created to appeal to someone . . ."

This is important to consider when looking at rhetorical velocity, especially digitally. Not only does a person need to consider the speed their information is being sent, but they also need to consider how quickly they need it, taking into account who will be receiving it and for what purpose. 

##### Classmate 2: murphy-post-1.md
This post states that articulating literacy "can mean to speak/utter OR a form of connection - literacy - isn't a fixed idea that's always used the same way, but rather an ongoing process of using ideas and communication depending on the situation". This, to me, ties into rhetorical literacy directly. I think that it could be argued that this is something that also needs to be considered in the attempts of Ridolfo and DeVoss to define the term rhetorical literacy. What is writing without that sense of constant communication, after all?

##### Classmate 3: writing-and-technology.md
When considering rhetorical velocity, it is also important to consider the writing being done rather than just speed. People cannot forget about the rhetorical part of this term. In this post, it is argued that "Not only has it [writing] changed the way literate minds think and view the world, it also affects many other aspects of language". I think it is interesting to consider how the increase of rhetorical velocity can influence writing. Although I am not entirely sure yet, it is definitely something that is worth considering later on. 

#### Questions for Discussion

1. How might you personally define rhetorical velocity? In what ways is it similar and/or different to immediacy? 
2. What is the significance of focusing on the digital aspect of rhetorical velocity within the course, rather than physical aspect? Have they not both developed in similar ways, progressing and reaching more people with improvements and new "technologies" over time?
3. How would rhetorical velocity be different for texting versus writing and sending a letter?
