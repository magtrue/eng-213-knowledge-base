### A Literary Technology
> "Writing (and especially alphabetic writing) is a technology, calling for the use of tools and other equipment, styli or brushes or pens, carefully prepared surfaces such as paper, animal skins, strips of wood, as well as inks or paints, and much more" (Ong 30).

Although society today views writing as a common part of everyday life, there was a time when it was viewed as a new form of technology. Writing was developed relatively late in human history, and only a small fraction of languages have a writing system. Even today, many languages remain purely oral. 

| Language Statistics | # |
| ------|----|
| How long humanity has existed | approx. 30,000 years |
| Oldest known script | less than 6,000 years old |
| Oldest known alphabet | less than 4,000 years old |
| Number of languages spoken today | 4,000 |
| Number of languages with a literature today | 78 |

Because of how novel the idea of writing remains to many cultures in today's society, some people have started to look at writing as a technological advancement and make comparisions between writing and the technology of today. For example, many of the arguments made against writing when it was first created are very similar to those used against computers by critics in today's society. Plato complained about how writing was unresponsive, destroyed memory, and couldn't defend itself like the spoken word could (Ong 27). These arguments reflect the worries of people today in relation to new technology, like the claim that a calculator weakens the mind. Additionally, many criticize the usage of technology since it limits interactions with other humans. While the spoken language or human interaction allow for in-person feedback and change, writing and computers do not. Despite this, technological advancements are inevitable, and once a technology begins to change a language, criticizing them becomes futile since it's impossible to criticize the changes without using the new technology itself to do so. 

### How Writing Affects Both the Mind and Society
> "Technologies are not mere exterior aids but also interior transformations of consciousness, and never more than when they affect the word" (Ong 32).

Because writing is a technology, it therefore evolves as culture evolves. Writing has has many impacts on how language has shifted from the spoken word. Not only has it changed the way literate minds think and view the world, it also affects many other aspects of language. According to Ong, it separates interpretation from facts, words from sounds, the writer from the reader, words from their spoken contexts, past from present, and more. By looking at all of this, it is clear to see that writing has affected every aspect of language and has therefore fundamentally changed the way we communicate with others and the way interact with and view the world around us.
